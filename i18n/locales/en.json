Or just made up news by the reporters as the Taiwan's NCC doesn't give a shit about the fake news they are promoting as they think it doesn't matter, this platform is a wake up call to the NCC to start to moderate news media corporations that do fake news.",
      "howdes": "We use web scraping to search for the latest news, and store it into a postgres database, for people to access, and the crawler is not like the OpenAI or any AI company, we just load the page once, and that's it nothing else on your page.",

      "userData": "We handle your account and password in a secure way, with two encryption methods, one during transit to the server (and also SQL injecton), one saving to the database. For other user data, it is currently NOT end-to-end encrypted, like your AI chat history, your stars, and your name & email. In the near future, we will add E2E encryption (and I can also pratice).",
      "mobileApp": "I will make a application using React Native in the future, but for now, mobile is not supported, but you can still kinda use it, it is just not pleasant."
