# Goals before the next devlog that NEEDS to be done at the end of the week.
1. Get the custom Groq api thingy work (really)
2. The user CAN change their account settings via the panel.
3. A working sources page (a basic one is fine)
4. A starring system.
5. Merge the Login system into settings.
6. Get the chat feature actually work? (and also can chat about news articles.)
